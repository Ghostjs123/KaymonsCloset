**Base Commands:**
* /kc print {Name} - prints all items in a gearset
* /kc printmissing {Name} - prints the missing items in a gearset
* /kc reset - reset KaymonsCloset back to its initial state

**Usage:<br/>**
Create your gearsets using the panel on your character screen. When updating the slots a
checkmark means always equip this item, and no checkmark means do not replace this item.

Equip gearsets through the minimap button, the character screen panel, or keybindings. All keybindings need to be assigned to each set in the panel and also bound in Interface Options.

**Notes:**
* This addon can not swap ANY inventory items in combat (including weapons).

This addon was made by Kaymon-Incendius \<Scuba Cops>. If you find 
bugs or other issues message him in game or on discord Kaymon#3528. A great deal of the UI code was used from the original outfitter so huge thanks to John Stephen.
